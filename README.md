This is my implementation of a sports database.

This database allows users to...
 - Manage athletes, events, and athlete-event relationships through an extensive interface.
 - Upload/download the database for future use.

In order to run the program on your own, you must compile it then execute the compiled program.

Here are some tests done with the program (some of these images have been altered due to sensitive information and changes in the program):
